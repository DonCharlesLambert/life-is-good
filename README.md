Shippuden Stories (formerly Life Is Good) is a Naruto fighting game made using the tkinter library for Python. Reminiscent of the browser flash games of yesteryear, it is a simple beat-em-up that features key characters from the series such as Naruto, Kakashi & Itachi.

  The game is played using the WASD and space keys, these keys are also used in character selection. The game is still a work in progress with projectiles, a main menu and a light story mode still to be added.
