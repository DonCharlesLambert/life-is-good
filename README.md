# Life Is Good
> _It's cool, man, got red bottoms on  
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like_

Let the 8-bit rendition of Future's "Life Is Good" take your mind back to a simpler time. Those year 8 days, playing Naruto MUGEN after school on a Tuesday with Jamal. 

Life was good, but life is better. 

Life Is Good is a Naruto fighting game made using the tkinter library for Python. The project is a hobby for when I want to procrastinate.
