## ðŸŒ€How to Write a Story
1. In the storyline folder create a new python file (e.g `kakashis_tale.py`)
2. Use `demo.py` as a guide for how to write it out
3. To test it edit `screens\story.py` to import your `STORY` instead of `storyline.demo.STORY`
	(Though do not include this particular change in your PR)
4. Raise a PR to add your story!

In the near future I (or another contributor!) will add functionality to choose which story to run without changing the import in `story.py`
  

## Help

In order of difficulty
1. WRITE THE STORY! Requires very little technical know-how. Just creativity!
2. Replace Gaara's sprites
3. Adding Sasuke
4. Adding Awakenings
5. Adding Projectiles

## Rules on AI Slop
I've only used LLMs for the "unglamorous" work: unit testing, writing markdowns and issues and coming up with a story. Please refrain from attempting to flood the codebase with AI Slop, that being, AI generated code, sprites or stories that clearly do not match the quality or cohesiveness of the codebase.
